# Project Plan: Retail Sales Prediction

## 1. Introduction:

SRS document lays down a project plan for the development of a “retail sales prediction platform”.
This Software Requirements document is intended for: 

- Developers who can review project’s capabilities and more easily understand where their efforts should be targeted to improve or add more features to it.
- Project testers can use this document as a base for their testing strategy. 
- End users of this application who wish to read about what this project can do.

The objective of this document is to outline the weekly requirements of the stocks needed by the retail sales company. The project will be involving Big Data technologies and  Machine Learning Algorithms to predict future stocks . The main purpose of this project is to gather and analyse the data of daily selling items and generate a report of daily sales, based on which the stocks will be  predicted for the upcoming week. It will help the company to store the stocks in advance so as to boost up their profit and to avoid customer in-convenience.

## 2. Overview:

In today’s world maintaining large records in any company is a very tedious and time consuming task. 
This record in turn needs to be processed and analysed so as to gain valuable insights and analysing these for the welfare of the company is again a very tough task .So there is a need for a platform which could run predictive analysis on this data . The retail sales company is the target audience so we will be focusing on a platform which could predict the stock for the upcoming week based on the historical data of the sales. The application requires the list of the selling items and a report of the daily sales to be collected and analysed then it will run the Machine Learning algorithm to predict the stocks needed for the upcoming week. The entire SRS is documented in the view of customer’s convenience, dealers and admin and the following subsections are arranged to complete outlook of the software, its perspective, features, System requirements.

### 2.1 Customers:

- The shop owner or the people working for a retail organization will be able to use this application.
- It will benefit them in keeping a track of the sales, requirement and various reports regarding these.

### 2.2 Functionality:

- It will help in keeping a record of available stock, sales and requirement.
- The shop owner/ head at retail organization will be able to make their account under owner category.
- The above respectively may add others working under them and grant them required access.
- Depending upon their access in the retail organization, they will be able to see sales and requirement.
- People belonging to same organization will be able to communicate with each other.
- As soon as only 20% of the desired requirement of a product remains in stock, a notification will be generated on the application for placement of order.
- Various features like graphical representation, profit and loss etc. will also be added for better understanding.
- An alarm notification will be sent if any loss is faced.
- Using various regression models, predictions can be made about the sales in a particular season using previous records.

Other features may be included with the progress of the project.

### 2.3 Platform

It will be a (processed and maintained) portal accessed through our official website as well as desktop software.  

### 2.4 Development Responsibility

We, the team of UsoC2020, would be developing the software and we are responsible for the creation of the Model, Database and all the other related stuffs.

## 3. Goals and Scopes

  -	From big enterprises, market chains to small retailers anyone can use this opensource product to maintain their stocks and logs.
  -	A ‘customized according to the user’ type of approach will be followed, hence it will be updated and customized according to your     needs, business size, employees.
  -	Our model based on your past sales and current ongoing sales, will learn and adapt and recommend to you about following attributes 
    -	Stock for the next week or month (as specified by the user)
    -	Best seller products
    -	Worst seller products
    -	Products with greatest profits and losses
    -	Demand trends according to you customer base and neighborhood
  -	 A unique user ID and password will be given to you business and your employees so that a record can be maintained 
  -	Users will be able to see employee work stats, sales stats, profit and loss stats as well as timely advices on how to manage your     store to maximize profits
  -	The stock predictions will be made by taking into account different festivals and nearby sports/political events.
  -	Feedback and customer care in case users feel any difficulty   

## 4. Deliverables:

I'll deliver the following during the course of development:

Test plan
Development document
Feature specification


## 5. Risk Management:

### 5.1 Risk Identification:

People are already using the some apps like Daily Sales Record, Sales Dairy etc.  to analyse the sales and handling their stocks. So, why people will use my application.

Analysis of the new product launched by the company due to the lack of historical sales data.

### 5.2 Risk Mitigation:

This application provides a convenient interface where one can have his Sales, Customers, Products, Stock needed and Reports in one place

This application will customize your sales report and also track top sold products

This application will have the record of all the customers and their contacts.

The application does the analysis keeping some factors(categorical data) such as whether condition, festival etc. 
for example:  if we take weather data: if the temperature is out of line with expectations, stock can be adjusted – bringing in more umbrellas or raincoats ahead of a rainy day.

The app can somehow, predict the sales of the new data by doing analysis on the same product line. For example, Google search trends can give a good idea of both time and spatial spread of demand, at no cost.  Likewise, for a pharmaceutical drug manufacturer, procuring data from specialized vendors about physician prescribing patterns might prove very useful.

This project is an excellent guide for planning budget and target for the stocks.
