# Project Plan: Retail Sales Prediction

## Introduction:

SRS document lays down a project plan for the development of a “retail sales prediction platform”.
This Software Requirements document is intended for: 

- Developers who can review project’s capabilities and more easily understand where their efforts should be targeted to improve or add more features to it.
- Project testers can use this document as a base for their testing strategy. 
- End users of this application who wish to read about what this project can do.

The objective of this document is to outline the weekly requirements of the stocks needed by the retail sales company. The project will be involving Big Data technologies and  Machine Learning Algorithms to predict future stocks . The main purpose of this project is to gather and analyse the data of daily selling items and generate a report of daily sales, based on which the stocks will be  predicted for the upcoming week. It will help the company to store the stocks in advance so as to boost up their profit and to avoid customer in-convenience.

## Overview:

In today’s world maintaining large records in any company is a very tedious and time consuming task. 
This record in turn needs to be processed and analysed so as to gain valuable insights and analysing these for the welfare of the company is again a very tough task .So there is a need for a platform which could run predictive analysis on this data . The retail sales company is the target audience so we will be focusing on a platform which could predict the stock for the upcoming week based on the historical data of the sales. The application requires the list of the selling items and a report of the daily sales to be collected and analysed then it will run the Machine Learning algorithm to predict the stocks needed for the upcoming week. The entire SRS is documented in the view of customer’s convenience, dealers and admin and the following subsections are arranged to complete outlook of the software, its perspective, features, System requirements.
