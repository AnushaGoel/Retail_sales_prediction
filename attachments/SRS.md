Feature specification


## 5. Risk Management:

### 5.1 Risk Identification:

People are already using the some apps like Daily Sales Record, Sales Dairy etc.  to analyse the sales and handling their stocks. So, why people will use my application.

Analysis of the new product launched by the company due to the lack of historical sales data.

### 5.2 Risk Mitigation:

This application provides a convenient interface where one can have his Sales, Customers, Products, Stock needed and Reports in one place

This application will customize your sales report and also track top sold products

This application will have the record of all the customers and their contacts.

The application does the analysis keeping some factors(categorical data) such as whether condition, festival etc. 
for example:  if we take weather data: if the temperature is out of line with expectations, stock can be adjusted â€“ bringing in more umbrellas or raincoats ahead of a rainy day.

The app can somehow, predict the sales of the new data by doing analysis on the same product line. For example, Google search trends can give a good idea of both time and spatial spread of demand, at no cost.  Likewise, for a pharmaceutical drug manufacturer, procuring data from specialized vendors about physician prescribing patterns might prove very useful.

This project is an excellent guide for planning budget and target for the stocks.
