## 2. Overview:

In today’s world maintaining large records in any company is a very tedious and time consuming task. 
This record in turn needs to be processed and analysed so as to gain valuable insights and analysing these for the welfare of the company is again a very tough task .So there is a need for a platform which could run predictive analysis on this data . The retail sales company is the target audience so we will be focusing on a platform which could predict the stock for the upcoming week based on the historical data of the sales. The application requires the list of the selling items and a report of the daily sales to be collected and analysed then it will run the Machine Learning algorithm to predict the stocks needed for the upcoming week. The entire SRS is documented in the view of customer’s convenience, dealers and admin and the following subsections are arranged to complete outlook of the software, its perspective, features, System requirements.
